## Accessing JPA Data with REST

This guide walks you through the process of creating 
an application that accesses relational JPA data through 
a hypermedia-based RESTful front end.

### What You Will Build

You will build a Spring application that lets you create 
and retrieve Person objects stored in a database by using 
Spring Data REST. Spring Data REST takes the features of 
Spring HATEOAS and Spring Data JPA and automatically 
combines them together.
